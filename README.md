# Library-Management-System
Simple library management system using django-ninja framework. 


## Introduction

This project demonstrates the simplicity and efficiency of using Django-Ninja for creating API calls. Django-Ninja leverages FastAPI, enabling developers to build fast API endpoints with CRUD operations. The objective of this project is to showcase these capabilities by storing and retrieving data in the backend.

## Special features

This application integrates LangChain LLM and Pinecone vectorstore to enhance its basic CRUD functionality with unique AI features. This allows users to make queries in natural language (English). The language learning model translates these queries into structured queries, which are stored as vectors in the Pinecone vectorstore database.

## Tech stack

1. Django-ninja FASTAPI
2. Langchain LLMs
3. Pinecone vectorstore
